System Patch Overall Structure and Design:
    (this is best viewed in a text editor like Visual Studio)

Hierarchically from root to deepest topic-level:

    _Overview
        • in >> Extras
        • is the root patcher that is parent to all the _system2.maxpat. 
        • to edit:
           ° right click next to the rightmost _system2 tab (e.g. Max, MSP, odot, etc - next to the rightmost one).
           ° click “Show Root Patcher on Tab” until it reveals the root.
           ° go to the root.
           ° delete the pile of dynamically instantiated [ CNMAT-Pedagogy_system2 ]’s that appear on the left
                it’s a bunch of patchers stacked like a deck of cards
           ° edit the structure of the Overview patch itself and save
		
    _system2


    _system3
